C-h k C-h k
This keystroke combination first runs the command describe-key, bound to C-h k, which displays documentation on the next keystroke(s) entered. Then, it displays the documentation for the next keystroke(s) entered.
Thus, when one types this combination twice, the documentation for this combination (C-h k) is displayed because the second 
time it is entered it is interpreted as the actual combination that the user would like the documentation for.

4. C-h k M-SPC
This keystroke combination runs the command describe-key followed by displaying the documentation for the M-SPC
keystroke. M-SPC runs the command just-one-space, which deletes all spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space (or N spaces).

5. General function for M-SPC:
cycle-spacing

Homework: Python scripting

1.
When randline.py is invoked with python 2 on an empty file, there is an index out of bounds error returned from the 
random module in python because there are no lines for it to choose from. When invoked with python 3, there is a syntax error and so the program will not run.

2. I was able to implement pattern matching in my program to detect incorrect ranges for the -i option of shuf but
generally it was less practical than using the isinstance() function which quickly allowed me to determine if
different argument options were used.

3. When shuf.py is invoked with python2, it gives a syntax error message because pattern matching is not supported in
   python2.
