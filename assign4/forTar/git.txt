The difference between the two is that the version I downloaded only contains
the main branch while the one in ~eggert/... contains the local branches maint, next
, seen, and todo as well. These additional branches are 'remote tracking branches',
which are local branches that have a direct relationship with a remote branch so that when one uses git push
or git pull, the branches know to automatically use each other's data. Someone must have ran the git checkout -b
command to create local copies of the remote branches. When one downloads the original repository, it includes
the information about the remote branches as well, so they are not lost, but one must use checkout to 
view them locally. If one uses git checkout -b <branch> --track <remote>/<branch>, a remote tracking branch is
established.
