This is a description of the code that fixes these problems from the commit message:
 In diff_unmerge(), NULL will be returned if the requested path is
    outside of the interesting directories, thus we'll run into NULL
    pointer dereference in run_diff_files when trying to dereference
    its return value.

    Checking for return value of diff_unmerge before dereferencing
    is not sufficient, though. Since, diff engine will try to work on such
    pathspec later.

    Let's not run diff on those unintesting entries, instead.
    As a side effect, by skipping like that, we can save some CPU cycles.

Essentially, they stopped running diff on 'uninteresting' directories which stopped a NULL pointer dereferencing,
which prevents incorrect results from this option.

To find this, I ran the command
git log | grep "git diff --relative" --context=10
while in the git repo I downloaded. I then used 'git show' on the branches of
the mergepoint to find the original commit that fixed the issue.

This command displayed the two commits with commit messages that mention
fixing these problems.
